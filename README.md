### Hi I am Lorenz, junior Fullstack Developer from Berlin, 

I recently completed my Web Development Course at DCI Berlin and am now seeking job opportunities in the field. My background in Philosophy and History has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and a strong ability to think in a logical and analytical manner.

I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, which I have used to build responsive and dynamic web applications. My expertise in these technologies allows me to create efficient and scalable solutions.

I am a quick learner and a team player who is always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. I am also experienced in using Git for version control and Agile development.

Please check out my portfolio and my Github to see some of my work.
